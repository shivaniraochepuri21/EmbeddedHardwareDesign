# EmbeddedHardwareDesign
lab0 implements Y = ABCD + A(bar) BCD + ABC D(bar) <br />
lab1 implements different kinds of adders with structural modelling <br />
lab2 implements j-k flipflop and pulse divide by four circuit <br />
lab3 implements GCD <br />
lab4 implements a Verilog 4-bit Pipelined Multiplier <br />
lab5 - synthesis and implementation report <br />
  Use your adder, gcd, multiplier and divider verilog files individually to do a synthesis and implementation under (i) Vivado with Zed board and (ii) Quartus Prime with MtGranite board as the targets. Submit a report comparing the four designs with respect to FPGA resource utilization, achieved clock frequency for your design and the power estimates reported by these tools. Please note that you do not need to actually generate a bitfile (and thus do not need a board) but only look at post-synthesis and post-implementation results and logfiles. <br />
